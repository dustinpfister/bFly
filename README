This is my 2013 game submission to js13kgames.com 2013 competition

controls: w,a,d keys, or touch and move on touch screens.

Poor Mr butterfly is on a hopeless mission to find the nectar he needs to survive, little does he know 
that he is in for some very bad luck. Well that does not keep him from trying to endure the futile endeavour of 
his existence.

The object of the game is to keep Mr bFly in the air, doing so costs nectar. You gain more nectar by 
flying over to the flowers that should be generated, based on your current luck. If you run out of nectar 
or fall to the bottom of the screen you loose.

Mr bFlys current amount of nectar as well as the maximum amount of nectar that he can hold is 
expressed in the red nectar half circle at the top of the screen. The probability of flower occurrence, 
as well as the amount of Nectar found in the flowers depends on Mr bFlys current "Luck" witch is 
displayed by a green half circle at the top of the screen. Every so often Mr bFlys luck will change for better
or worse, but as time goes by, sadly Mr bFly will experience very "bad luck". The amount of time to the 
next luck change is shown in final spring green half circle.
